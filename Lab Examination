During the whole semester we would be asked to simulate various different algorithms.

In the examination we would be asked to re write one of the already practised program.
apart from this we would also be given tasks that are theoretical in nature
if given correct answer for the question , we will be awarded 10 points
if the answer is not correct but the method that we had used was correct then we would be awarded partial grades

there are very less chances that anyone would fail in the practival lab examination
